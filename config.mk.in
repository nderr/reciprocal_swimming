# Reciprocal swimming config file

# Author : Nick Derr

#
# The C++ library in this repository was developed to calculate the steady
# flow arising from low-amplitude reciprocal swimming. It requires the
# installation of PETSc (for simulation) and gnuplot-iostream (for
# visualization.)
#
# Each of the variables below must be set to the following:
#
# petsc_dir: absolute path to the main petsc directory
# petsc_arch_complex_debug: absolute path to PETSc libraries compiled with
#   complex variables and debug flags
# petsc_arch_complex_opt: absolute path to PETSc libraries compiled with
#   complex variables and optimized flags
#
# gnuplot-iostream: absolute path to gnuplot-iostream.h, a header-only C++
#   interface to the gnuplot plotting utility written by Dan Stahlke
#
# Targets: all executables libraries depend clean

# for many PETSc installations, petsc_dir will be equal to the
# PETSC_DIR environment variable used when PETSc was compiled)
petsc_dir=/path/to/petsc/home/directory

# for many PETSc installations, petsc_dir will be equal to the
# value $PETSC_DIR/$PETSC_ARCH for the values of those two environment
# variables used when PETSc was compiled
#
# ..._debug requires a PETSc installation with debug flags
# ..._opt should point to an optimized PETSc installation
petsc_arch_complex_debug=/path/to/compiled/debug/petsc
petsc_arch_complex_opt=/path/to/compiled/opt/petsc

# gnuplot-iostream can be cloned from github
# gnuplot_io_loc should point to the cloned repository,
# which contains the header file

# paths to the include/ and lib/ directories containing
# a GSL installation
gsl_I=/path/to/gsl/include/dir
gsl_L=/path/to/gsl/lib/dir

# path to the lib/ directory containing the BLAS installation
# of choice. Replace -lBLASFLAG with the appropriate library
# name, e.g. -lopenblas for OpenBLAS
